A pure Python library and utilities for reading and manipulating Windows Installer (MSI) files. Based on the rust msi crate and msitools utilities.

To get started `pip install python-msi`. To use it as a library, `import pymsi`. For the CLI utility, run `pymsi help` for a list of supported commands.

Want to give it a try without installing anything? Check out the [MSI file viewer](msi_viewer.md), which uses pymsi to view MSI files entirely client-side in your browser via Pyodide.
